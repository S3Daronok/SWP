# SWP (Standard Weapons Pack): Resourcepack and Datapack

## Using options

### Github Releases

Go to the [Github Releases](https://github.com/S3Daronok/SWP/releases) page of our repo, select a Version and download the `datapack.zip` and `ressourcepack.zip` file. You don't need to unpack them, just move `datapack.zip` to `.minecraft/saves/[world_name]/datapacks` and `ressourcepack.zip` to `.minecraft/resourcepacks`. You can rename these files if you want.

### Using `pack`

Download this repo via git or as a zip file. If you download a zip file you have to unpack if. Now you can execute the `pack.bat` file (Sometimes this is displayed only `pack`). This will ask you some questions.

If something is in bracket, this meens, this is the default answer. You just have to type enter if this is correct.

If you only want the ressourcepack you can execute the `ressourcepack.bat` file and if you only want the datapack or add the datapack to another world you can execute the `datapack.bat` file.
